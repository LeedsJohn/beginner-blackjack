# Vue Blackjack
I created this project while working through "Vue - The Complete Guide" by Maximilian Schwarzmuller to practice some of the techniques I have learned. I created this viewing it through a phone-sized browser. While I would have liked to make it responsive, I feel like I have accomplished my learning goals.

This was my first project where I wrote my own HTML and CSS (mostly) from scratch. I also learned about the syntax of creating classes in JavaScript during the creation.
